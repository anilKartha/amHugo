<p>Eighteen anthologies. One hundred-plus authors from over fifteen countries. Hundred-plus stories. Half-a-million words. The anthologies listed here span a multitude of genres, authors, countries, words and ideas. They also include some of my stories. Getting hold of some of these anthos is a bit tricky. Once,the cheapest way to buy a new book was to go to the publisher’s store or a bricks-and-mortar bookstore. That’s not true anymore. A lot of anthologies are one-off efforts and the publisher may no longer be around to offer deals. Even if they are, online bookstores often have better deals. I like to use the <a href="https://www.bookfinder.com/" target='blank'>Bookfinder site</a>. The cover-images are linked, where possible, to the publisher's sites.</p>
